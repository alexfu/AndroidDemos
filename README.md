# AndroidDemos
This repository serves as a place for me to experiment with Android APIs. In addition to helping me learn more about unfamiliar APIs, hopefully others can benefit from this.

# Goal
My goal with this is to create samples that are well documented and well formed. Just because it's a sample, doesn't mean the code needs to be unorganized.
